## Contributing

#### Cloning the project

You can clone the project using GIT. The master branch always contains the latest stable code. The `develop` branch always contains the latest changes (but is unstable).

`git clone git@github.com:tijme/raivo.git`

#### CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. Install it using the instructions on their website [www.cocoapods.org](https://cocoapods.org/). Afterwards, navigate to the project root and install all the pods.

`pod install`

#### Making changes

Make sure you open **Raivo.xcworkspace** instead of the default project file. Opening Raivo.xcworkspace will make sure Xcode loads all the pods.

#### Compiling

You can now compile the app for every iOS 11 device using Xcode!
