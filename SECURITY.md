# Security Policies and Procedures

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for Raivo.

  * [Reporting a vulnerability](#reporting-a-vulnerability)
  * [Disclosure policy](#disclosure-policy)
  * [Third party modules](#third-party-modules)

## Reporting a vulnerability

We consider the security of Raivo a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into security, there can still be vulnerabilities present. If you discover a security vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. We would like to ask you to help us better protect our users and the app.

We are currently in the progress of creating a HackerOne page. In the meantime, please report your security vulnerability to the lead maintainer at `security[at]finnwea[dot]com`.

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 2 business days, and will send a more detailed response within 2 more business days indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

We strive to resolve all problems as quickly as possible, and we would like to play an active role in the ultimate publication on the problem after it is resolved.

## Disclosure policy

When the security team receives a security vulnerability report, they will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the vulnerability and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit the code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare a fix for the upcoming release or a dedicated release. 
  * Publish the fix to the Apple App Store as soon as possible.

## Third party modules

If you find a security vulnerability in a third party module that is in use by Raivo, please report the vulnerability to the person or team maintaining the module.
